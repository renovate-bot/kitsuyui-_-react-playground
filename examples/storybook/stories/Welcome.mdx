# Welcome

import { Canvas, Meta } from '@storybook/blocks'

import * as ClockStories from './clock/Example.stories'

<Canvas of={ClockStories.Default} />

This is a collection of React components by [Kitsuyui](https://github.com/kitsuyui).

## Install

```sh
$ npm install @kitsuyui/react-clock @kitsuyui/react-stopwatch @kitsuyui/react-timer
```

## Usage

Clock, Stopwatch, Timer, etc. change their state depending on the time.
To separate the change of the state and the representation of the UI, I use React Context.
For example, the following code is a clock that displays the current time in Tokyo.

```tsx
import {
  AnalogClock,
  ClockContainer,
  DateContext,
  DigitalClock,
} from '@kitsuyui/react-clock'
import React from 'react'

const Clock = () => {
  return (
    <ClockContainer refreshInterval={10}>
      <DateContext.Consumer>
        {(date) => (
          <>
            <AnalogClock timezone="Asia/Tokyo" date={date} />
            <DigitalClock timezone="Asia/Tokyo" date={date} />
          </>
        )}
      </DateContext.Consumer>
    </ClockContainer>
  )
}
```

`ClockContainer` is a component that manages the state of the clock.
The `refreshInterval` property is the interval at which the clock is updated.
`AnalogClock` and `DigitalClock` are components that display the clock. These components are independent of the state of the clock.
